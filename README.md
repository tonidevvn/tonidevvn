## Hi everyone, I'm Toni 👋

I'm a Software engineer (Python, Java & .NET) and Full Stack Developer (ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJs, Spring boot, Django) 💻 
Traveling is another passion of mine. ✈️

👀 Software development is my profession and my hobby. 

🌱 I’m currently learning more about Machine Learning & Cloud Web Services to deploy more and more applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, web design challenges, and algorithm contests.
